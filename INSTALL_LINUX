                     Installation of openCaesar3 on Linux


The opencaesar3 software uses the original (c) Caesar3 art for graphics, sounds and animations.
For copyright reasons, I do not upload Caesar3 material.
Therefore you need to install Caesar3 to install opencaesar3.

1. Extract the picture files

1.a Install Caesar3

* You only need the Caesar3 CD.
insert your CaesarCD (mounted in /media/CAESAR3 for example)
cd ~
mkdir caesar3_orig
cd caesar3_orig
unshield x /media/CAESAR3/data1.CAB

=> this will extract all files from the data1.CAB archive to your local directory
=> you need to install the "unshield" package if you don't have it already.


1.b Install dependencies

sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ libarchive-dev zlib1g-dev zlib1g unshield libsdl1.2* libsdl-image1.2* libsdl-mixer1.2* libboost1.50* libsdl-ttf2.0* qt4-dev-tools ctags


1.c Install and launch SGReader

* Download the SGReader tool "sgreader-src.tar.gz"
cd ~
tar xvzf sgreader-src.tar.gz
cd sgreader-src
qmake
make

=> this extracts and compiles the source code.


1.d Run the SGReader tool

cd ~/sgreader-src
./sgreader
in File/Batch_Extract...
Select the input folder:
  Select the directory where you installed Caesar3 (eg: ~/caesar3)
Choose files to extract:
  Select C3.sg2, C3_North.sg2 and C3_south.sg2
Set the output folder:
  Use a temporary directory of your choice (eg: ~/caesar3_extract)
Run the extraction...
Images extracted:
  you should get approx 26314 extracted images, and 124 skipped images.


2. Install opencaesar3

2.a Download opencaesar3 archive, for example: caesar_2012_05_21.20_55_51.tgz

cd ~
tar xvzf caesar_2012_05_21.20_55_51.tgz
cd opencaesar3
make

2.b Install

./install.sh --pic-dir ~/caesar3_extract --data-dir ~/caesar3_orig
ln -s /usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf .
